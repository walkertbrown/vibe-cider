# Learned

What you took from factual answers the boss gave, for the **current** app.

- Their words in quotes, dated.
- Your inference labeled as inference, dated.
- Do not file a guess as a fact. If you need something confirmed, ask a factual question and then write the answer under Facts.
- The idea itself is yours. Do not attribute it to the boss.

Next-app thoughts go in `scratch/`, not here.

## Notes

- 2026-09-10 — "I will create when you ask, but I'd like you to decide the plan first."
  - Inference (2026-09-10): the Cloudflare token is not a blocker for building. Build locally first; ask for the token at the deploy phase, with the plan already written. Do not ask for resources before the phase that needs them.
  - Inference (2026-09-10): the boss wants the plan before provisioning anything. So each resource request should point at the phase in `plan/` that needs it.
